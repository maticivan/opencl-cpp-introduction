This file contains the sequence that is to be read by the program. 

Integers (and minus signs) are treated seriously by the program.

However, everything else is ignored. Specifically, the text that you are reading at the moment is ignored by the program who is searching for integers only. 

So far there was not a single integer in the file, and the program is ignoring all of this writing.

The first integer in the file is very special. It informs the program on how many elements the sequence will contain in total. 

For this particular file we will chose that number to be: 

***NUMBER OF ELEMENTS OF THE SEQUENCE***       2000

List of the first few elements of the sequence:
-2 (negative two)
3 (three)
0 (zero)
1 (one)
1 (etc)
 0 0 0 5 7 -7 12 8
5
-9
Once the program sees this number negative nine, it stops reading. The remaining terms will be randomly generated. Actually, they will be generated from the set 

0, 1, 2, ..., 19.

If you want a fancy random number generator, you will have to modify the C++ code in generatingSequenceFromFile.cpp
